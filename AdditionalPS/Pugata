PUGATA		
The program receives an array of names of players who are about to play the game of hide and seek. 
But the players need a software to decide who will be having the turn to find the other players as 
each one of them doubts the special abilities of other players 
to find out the side of the hand (inwards or outwards) they will show.

The rules of PUGATA are:
1. The majority of inwards or outwards hand will decide, 
which players have escaped the turn for now.
2. If the hand count of inwards or outwards are same, 
then it shall continue.(I.e. not freeing any player in that pass)
3. If only two players are left for the last pass, then the player whose name 
comes first in the dictionary will be the one having the turn.
